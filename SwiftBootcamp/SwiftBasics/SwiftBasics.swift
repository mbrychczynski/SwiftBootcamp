import Foundation

var greeting = "Hello, Swift"
//print("greeting")


// This is a single-line comment
// Another single-line comment

/*
 
 This is a multi-line comment
 that goes to
 multiple lines!
 
 */

// Naming Conventions
// Camel Case! - in Swift we use Camel Case naming convention

// The first word is lowercased and then the first character in every following word is uppercased

// CORRECT
let firstGreeting = "Hello, world"
let thisIsMyFirstGreeting = "Hello, world"

// WRONG - hard to read
let thisismysecondgreeting = "Hello, world"
